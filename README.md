# Skyscape Wordpress Theme
Clean theme with only full-screen single photo and optional navigation bar. Meant for sites that have no content. Blog title and description are shown in the center of the image as a short introductory message. Menu bar is intended for external links only as no posts or pages are rendered. Any additional content is ignored.
